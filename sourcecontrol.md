Popular source control tools are based on two open source technologies 
* Subversion 
* Git

There are different providers which used above technologies and offers product on top of it. Subversion got evolved overtime but it is in sunset mode  in 2021 as everyone try to move into git  based product.

The popular git based products are 
* github
* gitlab
* bitbucket

Most  of the tools are now offered as SaaS product so the administration activity is negligible.

Some of the  area to be covered later on git are
* Different open source implementation

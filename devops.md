Its the one of the area of IT to bridge between teams and work towards automating everything to run the code in live.

It think it will be good to share my view on how DevOps evolved over a decade, In 2010 when there is no DevOps it was quite a large team to manage different tool set. Some of them are,
* Configuration management (Manage the source code)
* Build Management (build the code and deploy it in environment)
* Middleware Admins (Manages the application server like Jboss, Weblogic, Websphere)
* Infrastructure (Split into different area like Hardware, Network, Storage and OS)
* Release Management (Govern the release)

And more..

It is difficult for managers to direct different team and as they are split apart and have their own goal within the team.

To solve above problem they tried to group people from different team mentioned above to work together and share knowledge with each other so the development can be supported by a single one instead of different teams.

During the evolution of cloud tech, many tools got developed and ease work of support team,  only issue is they need to know how to code as most of them work on UI based tools and didn't  like to code. This bring niche members who are part off the above team but like to code which got evolved as DevOps where the people think of coding everything on their way and not to worry about issue and repeated activity.

DevOps got evolved after 2015 along with agile where every scrum team a member of DevOps to fully or partially support their team. Since the whole bunch of team replaced by new term DevOps resolves many issues and fast track the development.

Since more organization are moving into agile and DevOps got more attention due their importance which glue all together to accomplish the goal.

Current year 2021 DevOps still good role and need a certain set of skill to accomplish it.

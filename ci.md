Continuous Integration(CI) is a process or practice to enable the development life cycle in a single pipeline to reduce the complexity to achieve faster development. The development process involves coding, build, deploy application and invoke various testing using CI tools. We can build a robust pipeline that includes all stages of moving the code after development to production. 

Some of the stages of CI 
* Get code from repository
* Built into package 
* To unit & integration testing 
* Storing the artefact
*  Deploying deploying to target server. 

CI is a centre of devops lifecycle and trying to integrate with all tools and helps to set up the pipeline with various stages. The most popular  CI tool is  jenkins which has vast plugin base and it is a open source.

# Summary
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables users to deploy and manage virtual machines in the cloud. Azure VMs offer a scalable and flexible infrastructure for running a variety of workloads, from simple applications to complex enterprise solutions.

With Azure VMs, users have the freedom to choose from a wide range of pre-configured virtual machine images or create their own custom images. This allows for the flexibility to run different operating systems, including Windows Server, Linux distributions, and specialized images for specific applications.

Azure VMs provide the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand, allowing users to adjust the compute power, memory, and storage of their virtual machines as needed. This scalability helps optimize performance and control costs.

Additionally, Azure VMs offer features such as virtual networking, load balancing, and virtual machine extensions, enabling users to configure their virtual machines to meet specific networking and application requirements.

Azure VMs integrate seamlessly with other Azure services, allowing users to take advantage of features like Azure Storage for data persistence, Azure Backup for automated backups, and Azure Monitor for monitoring and managing the health and performance of their virtual machines.

In summary, Azure Virtual Machines is a powerful service that provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure for deploying and managing virtual machines in the cloud, offering a wide range of configuration options, scalability, and integration with other Azure services.

## List of Azure Virtual Machine Services
 * Azure Virtual Machines: This is the core service that allows you to create and manage virtual machines in the cloud. It offers a variety of VM sizes and types, supporting both Windows and Linux operating systems.

 * Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets: This service enables you to create and manage a set of identical VMs that can automatically scale based on demand. It simplifies the management of large-scale applications and ensures high availability.

 * Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances: This service provides cost savings by allowing you to reserve VM instances for one or three years, offering significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.

 * Azure Spot Virtual Machines: This service allows you to take advantage of unused Azure capacity at significantly reduced costs. Spot VMs can be evicted with short notice, but they are ideal for non-critical workloads or tasks that can tolerate interruptions.

 * Azure Dedicated Host: This service provides dedicated physical servers for your VMs, offering control over the underlying infrastructure, including host-level affinity and compliance requirements.

 * Azure VM Extensions: These are plug-ins that can be installed on VMs to enable additional functionality or management capabilities, such as diagnostics, monitoring, security, or custom script execution.

 * Azure Bastion: This service provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH access to your VMs directly from the Azure portal, eliminating the need for public IP addresses or VPN connections.

 * Azure Image Gallery: This service allows you to create and manage custom VM images that can be used as templates for rapid VM deployment. It simplifies the provisioning of consistent environments and accelerates application deployment.

 * Azure Marketplace: This is a vast repository of pre-configured VM images and other software solutions from various vendors. It offers a wide range of applications, operating systems, and development stacks that can be easily deployed on Azure VMs.

 * Azure Migrate: This service provides assessment and migration tools to facilitate the migration of on-premises virtual machines to Azure VMs. It helps with workload discovery, compatibility assessment, and seamless migration planning.

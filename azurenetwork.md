### Summary
Azure Network Service is a comprehensive set of networking tools and solutions offered by Microsoft Azure. This service provides a range of options for networking your resources in the cloud, including Virtual Network (VNet), Load Balancer, Application Gateway, VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, and Traffic Manager.

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) allows you to create a logically isolated network in the cloud, and you can control traffic flow with Azure Load Balancer, Application Gateway, and Traffic Manager. Azure VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute provide secure connectivity options between your on-premises infrastructure and your Azure resources.

Azure Network Service also provides a range of security features, including Network Security Groups (NSG), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection, and Azure Firewall. These features help you protect your resources from unauthorized access, network attacks, and other security threats.

Overall, Azure Network Service is a flexible and scalable solution that allows you to easily create and manage your cloud networking infrastructure, with a wide range of options for connectivity, security, and traffic management.

## List of Azure network services
 * Virtual Network (VNet): This service allows you to create a logically isolated network in the cloud and enables you to connect Azure resources to each other, to on-premises networks, and to the internet.

 * Load Balancer: This service distributes inbound network traffic across multiple virtual machines to improve the availability and scalability of your applications.

 * Application Gateway: This service is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It offers features such as SSL termination, URL-based routing, and session affinity.

 * VPN Gateway: This service provides secure connectivity options between your on-premises infrastructure and your Azure resources over the public internet. It supports site-to-site VPN and point-to-site VPN connections.

 * ExpressRoute: This service provides dedicated, private network connectivity between your on-premises infrastructure and your Azure resources over a private, high-speed connection.

 * Traffic Manager: This service enables you to distribute traffic across multiple endpoints in different regions or availability zones for improved application performance and availability.

 * Network Security Groups (NSG): This service is a firewall-like feature that allows you to control inbound and outbound traffic to your Azure resources.

 * DDoS Protection: This service provides automatic protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on your Azure resources.

 * Azure Firewall: This service is a cloud-based network security service that provides network-level protection for your Azure resources.

 * Azure Private Link: This service allows you to access Azure services over a private endpoint within your virtual network, avoiding exposure to the public internet.
